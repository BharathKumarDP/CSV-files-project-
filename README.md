 A simple python project done as a part of **CSAU** club of CEG.It's a very basic project! :)
It involves working with CSV files using the python [csv library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) 
to merge input csv files and analyze them to give an output file containing the cleaned up data.
The data handled is a record of books in a Library.
As a bonus, used [matplotlib library](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) to plot 2 graphs based on the data.
